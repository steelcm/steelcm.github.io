But, because journalists are constantly pitched about new products, standing out from the crowd can be difficult.</p><span>\n</span><p>Whether you’re an established business, or you're&nbsp;just getting started, it’s never too soon to let people know about your product. Choosing the best outlet to promote your business is only half the battle.</p><span>\n</span><p>We’re going to look at some of the most clever ways you can get any influencer or journalist’s attention—even in a crowded space—so you can get more traffic and sales for your business.</p><span>\n</span><h2>How to get press coverage by bypassing traditional methods</h2><span>\n</span><p>Getting traditional press coverage can be an extremely difficult process. Often, journalists and editors are overloaded day and night with pitches.</p><span>\n</span><p>Every day there are thousands of <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/blog/how-to-write-a-press-release\" target=\"_blank\">press releases</a> sent out. No wonder its hard to get noticed.</p><span>\n</span><p>Because of this, contacting blogs that are targeted to your niche, rather than pitching your product to a traditional news outlet can be much more effective, and is a much less saturated area to tackle. &nbsp;</p><span>\n</span><p>Quite often, you’ll find that blogs have a page for you to submit product tips. As an example, take a look at <a href=\"http://mashable.com/submit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Mashable’s Submit News</a> page. You can use this to your advantage.</p><span>\n</span><p>Best of all, it’s <b>totally free</b>.</p><span>\n</span><h2>How to find top bloggers and influencers</h2><span>\n</span><p>You can leverage the power of Google to make your life much easier when hunting down sites to contact. &nbsp;</p><span>\n</span><p>By simply doing a Google search for sites related to your product or niche, you’ll be able to find blogs, journalists and influencers that can get the word out about your product.</p><span>\n</span><p>These blogs and influencers are extremely valuable, as their readers and followers are all potential customers. &nbsp;</p><span>\n</span><p>According to a study from Nielsen, <a href=\"http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/press-room/2012/nielsen-global-consumers-trust-in-earned-advertising-grows.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">92% of buyers</a> trust recommendations and products from people they know, and 70% trust opinions and reviews they find online.</p><span>\n</span><p>Here’s some of the best search strings to use:</p><span>\n</span><ul>\n<li><em>top X bloggers</em></li>\n<li><em>blogs like X</em></li>\n<li><em>X product reviews</em></li>\n<li><em>X influencers</em></li>\n<li><em>X product influencers</em></li>\n</ul><span>\n</span><p>You’ll want to grab as much information as you can. Anything from a contributor’s first and last name, to their email address, to where they live—all of this can be useful.</p><span>\n</span><p>Be sure to check out some of their recent work as well, as it’s always nice to mention that you like their work when reaching out to them.</p><span>\n</span><div id=\"GuideCta\"><span>\n  </span><div class=\"grid grid--equal-height grid--vertically-centered guide-cta background-light\"><span>\n    </span><div class=\"grid__item grid__item--tablet-up-third\"><span>\n      </span><span class=\"image lazyload-image guide-cta__image gutter-bottom--mobile\"><span class=\"lazyload-image__placeholder\"><img data-sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/oie_18184256C4yLVRB.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\"><noscript><img sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/oie_18184256C4yLVRB.gif\" alt=\"\"></noscript></span></span><span>\n</span></div><span>\n    </span><div class=\"grid__item grid__item--tablet-up-two-thirds guide-cta__content\"><span>\n      </span><h3 class=\"guide-cta__heading\">\n        Free Reading List: How to Brand Your Business\n      </h3><span>\n\n      </span><p>A great brand can help your products stand out from the crowd.

You’ll want to go through these blogs and make sure that you have <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/blog/12206313-the-ultimate-diy-guide-to-beautiful-product-photography\" target=\"_blank\">product shots</a> that match their aesthetic.</p><span>\n</span><p>Sometimes its seemingly impossible to track down the people who curate these blogs. So how do you get in touch if there’s no obvious way of contacting them?</p><span>\n</span><p>Be inventive in your approach.</p><span>\n</span><ul>\n<li>Use Google to find out if the blog is working under another company. For instance, Uncrate works under Zombiecorp LLC. Contacting them directly is a creative way to get past all of their regular contact submissions.</li>\n</ul><span>\n</span><ul>\n<li>Perform a <a href=\"http://whois.domaintools.com/uncrate.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">WHOIS search</a> to find out the owner of the domain name and contact them through the email address listed there.</li>\n</ul><span>\n</span><ul>\n<li>Find businesses that have been featured on these blogs, and contact them directly to see if they can provide any contact info or insight into the curation process.</li>\n</ul><span>\n</span><ul>\n<li>Find one of the writers on LinkedIn and send them a connect request. Make sure you send them a custom message that's not too long.</li>\n</ul><span>\n</span><ul>\n<li>Send them a Facebook message if you can find their personal profile. Don’t be too pushy with this one though—some people prefer to keep their Facebook profile private.</li>\n</ul><span>\n</span><ul>\n<li>Tweet at them directly, as well as the company or blog they write for. <a href=\"https://followerwonk.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Followerwonk</a> is a fantastic service that will help you dig into this information.</li>\n</ul><span>\n</span><ul>\n<li>See if there is a phone number that you can leave them a voicemail at. Use this one as a last resort, and make sure to make it quick and concise.</li>\n</ul><span>\n</span><h2>Spying on your competitors</h2><span>\n</span><p>Another great way to find places to contact is to check your competitors’ backlinks. This tactic is extremely simple.</p><span>\n</span><p>The best way to do this is through a service like <a href=\"https://moz.com/link-explorer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">OpenSiteExplorer</a>.</p><span>\n</span><p>Just head over to their page, and input your competitor’s domain name.</p><span>\n</span><p><img data-auto-seo=\"h2\" alt=\"Spying on Your Competitors\" title=\"Spying on Your Competitors\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/opensiteexplorer.png?7139&amp;format=jpg&amp;quality=90\" class=\"lazyload\"></p><span>\n</span><p>Next, you’ll want to make sure you’re looking at the inbound links tab.</p><span>\n</span><p><img data-auto-seo=\"h2\" alt=\"Spying on Your Competitors\" title=\"Spying on Your Competitors\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/inboundlinkstab.png?7140&amp;format=jpg&amp;quality=90\" class=\"lazyload\"></p><span>\n</span><p>From there, take a look at the list of inbound links.</p><span>\n</span><p><img data-auto-seo=\"h2\" alt=\"Spying on Your Competitors\" title=\"Spying on Your Competitors\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/inboundlinks.png?7141&amp;format=jpg&amp;quality=90\" class=\"lazyload\"></p><span>\n</span><p>From this list, you can see where your competitor is getting their traffic from. All that you have to do now, is reach out to these websites.</p><span>\n</span><h2>Reach out, don't pitch</h2><span>\n</span><p>You’ll find that if you send out a generic email, you probably won’t get a response. You’re looking for a long-term relationship instead of quick-hit story coverage so that you can reach out to them every time you have a new product.</p><span>\n</span><p>There’s a few things you can do to almost guarantee a response.</p><span>\n</span><ul>\n<li>Have a strong email subject that gets their attention and makes them want to open your email immediately. Avoid things like using all caps.</li>\n</ul><span>\n</span><ul>\n<li>Include a phone number they can reach you at in case they have any questions.</li>\n</ul><span>\n</span><ul>\n<li>Offer a product sample, even if you have to pay for it.</li>\n</ul><span>\n</span><ul>\n<li>Add some personality to your email.</li>\n</ul><span>\n</span><ul>\n<li>Followup after a week if they don’t respond.</li>\n</ul><span>\n</span><p>Here’s an example of a generic email. Try to avoid something like this.</p><span>\n</span><p><img data-auto-seo=\"h2\" alt=\"Reach Out, Don't Pitch\" title=\"Reach Out, Don't Pitch\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/bademail.png?7142&amp;format=jpg&amp;quality=90\" class=\"lazyload\"></p><span>\n</span><p>It’s obvious that this is a copy and pasted email, or that the person reaching out has no interest in forming a relationship.</p><span>\n</span><p>Here’s an example of the same email, but reworked to get more attention and to start a long-lasting relationship.</p><span>\n</span><p><img data-auto-seo=\"h2\" alt=\"Reach Out, Don't Pitch\" title=\"Reach Out, Don't Pitch\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/Screen_Shot_2014-11-21_at_1.57.39_PM.png?7144&amp;format=jpg&amp;quality=90\" class=\"lazyload\"></p><span>\n</span><p>Don’t be afraid to go out of your comfort zone when you’re reaching out.
